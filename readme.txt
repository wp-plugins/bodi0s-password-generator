Brain-free generation and usage of random sequence of numbers and/or text or special characters in password fields while creating or editing users.

== Description ==
Tired to think about what should be the new password while creating or editing users? This small plugin will do the job for you. 
It generates and uses a random sequence of numbers and/or text or special characters in password fields during creating or editing users.
The password is with variable length and can be generated on-the-fly (no page reload is necessary). It consists from lower letters, upper letters, numbers and/or special characters. To do that, go to `Users` and `Add new` one or edit existing one.
